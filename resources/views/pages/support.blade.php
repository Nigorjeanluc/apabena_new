                          In Education we provide necessary school equipments for no any other reason, only for promoting education for children, mostly vulnerable ones. Because Education is the best strategy to contribute to the country development. 
                          It is also considered as the first aim here in APABENA. For the same reason we have supported 228 children to get access on education, 193 graduated (44 with A<span><sub>2</sup></span> diploma and 149 with Certificate of professional trainings).
