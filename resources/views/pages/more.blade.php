                <span style="color:black" class="pullquote-left"><p class="lead">
				The vision of APABENA is to have the country where child rights are respected to allow all children realize their full potential of physical and psychological development.
				As we already know the child is the father or the mother of man meaning that preparing a child since the childhood is like contributing to the development of the country, 
				because if a child is living more likely in problems, like violence and such. He/She will not be the man we want for tomorrow, so if we want to have a better country with good leaders with 
				integrity and development, we better prepare children. So our vision drives to the development of our society for tomorrow.

                <h4 align="center">Mission</h4>
                <span style="color:black" class="pullquote-left"><p class="lead">
				The core mission of the organisation is moral and psychological assistance of non-accompanied children.
				We try to give assistance in terms of ideas (psychologically) and in terms of materials (physically) to vulnerable children; we give them the 
				chances to discover their potential and to reach thier dreams as well, because we never know who they would be in the future. So we have to prevent them from
				any kind of suffering, violence; to report whoever abuses their rights.
